        <h1>What Akshita says?</h1>
        <p>Hello this is Akshita Sharma.If you here to know about me, lemme tell you "I also don't know about me". So jokes apart , I am currently a student of II year in University Maharani College, pursuing BCA(when I am making this portfolio).I am living in Jaipur, the "Pink city". The motto of my life is to travel, to explore, to capture, to learn and to grow. And yes you need money to travel, and that is why I am here with a computer application degree (no no that is not 100% truth but yup 99.9%+ is it), actually I don't know when I got interest in this field but today I can say if I was not doing this, I have nothing else to do(keep that photographer's soul aside). So finally,basically,technically I want to be a Software Engineer.So my journey begins when I was born on 11th July 2004(that world's population day,huh!) then years later as a normal child I got admitted to school for education, primary, secondary and senior secondary, BTW I done my schooling from same school i.e. Beacon Public School(my papa's favourite school)then unluckly I got admission in University Maharani college(every parent's dream college)then here I am working on this project that i shoukd start earlier but its okay , its never late. </p>
